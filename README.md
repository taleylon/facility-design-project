# Facility Design Project
This project's subject is a simulation of a 15X9 puzzle-based warehouse, with items scattered in 10 different settings.<br>
The objective is to take out 20 items with 5 robots (that can move simultaneously accross the warehouse) at the lowest time possible.<br>
This project offers an heuristic approach to this problem.
